# Code Smell Detection

---

## 📝 Project Overview

Code smells are subtle indicators of poor code quality that can lead to technical debt. This project identifies code smells using machine learning techniques, emphasizing:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Detecting code smells like Long Method, Large Class, and God Object.
- Leveraging correlation analysis and machine learning methods for feature selection.

## 📂 Project Workflow

1. **Data Overview & Preprocessing**:
   - Dataset loaded from `attribute-details.csv`.
   - Preprocessing involves cleaning data, removing missing values, and encoding categorical features.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Correlation analysis identifies relationships between features.
   - Features are refined using a threshold of 0.1 or higher for relevance to the "CodeSmell" target variable.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Multiple machine learning models are trained, including:
     - Random Forest
     - Bagging Classifier
     - KNN
     - XGBoost
   - Hyperparameter tuning optimizes model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualizations include confusion matrices and feature importance plots.

## 🧪 Results

- The **Bagging Classifier** and **Random Forest** demonstrated consistent performance across all feature selection techniques, achieving accuracy rates exceeding **82%**.
- **Correlation-based feature selection** resulted in the lowest misclassification rates, effectively retaining relevant and non-redundant features.
- Models struggled with detecting positive instances, as evidenced by higher counts of **false negatives**, despite class imbalance mitigation using SMOTE.
- Among all models, **KNN** exhibited the lowest accuracy (**70.1%**), indicating sensitivity to feature selection.
- The **Bagging Classifier** emerged as the most robust model, achieving a **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)** of **0.66**, followed by Random Forest at **0.64**.

These results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning methods and strategic feature selection in improving the reliability of code smell detection.
